          <p>Recently, the Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Executive Director, Amy Ford, met privately with a handful of residents along W 29th Ave after public-engagement had ended for the W 29th Ave safe and active street intervention, reversing course on a protected bike lane along the corridor. This occurred after announcing that the design was final and construction was about to begin. Use the link below to email Director Ford, the Mayor's office, and the DOTI AB Board to let them know this is unacceptable and to install the bike lane as planned.</p>
